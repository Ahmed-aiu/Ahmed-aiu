        #                 Then identify the categories <System 1>, <System 2>, ... that are relevant in the RFQ. Do not identify categories that are not mentioned in DEPSTRUCT and list only the most important categories. Do not list more than 5 categories.
        #                 Then identify the work activities <work activity 1>, <work activity 2>, ... in the RFQ that belong to the identified work activities (DEVDIS). Do not identify work activities that are not mentioned in DEPSTRUCT.
        #                 Afterwards identify the responsible departments <department-1>, <department-2>, ... which are responsible for both the identified categories/SYSTEMS as well as work activities (DEVDIS). Do not identify departments that are not mentioned in DEPSTRUCT.
        #                 Estimate the share of responsibility in percent of each department <responsibility-share-department-1>, <responsibility-share-department-2>, ... in the RFQ. The responsibility should represent the relevance of the RFQ for the identified departments while the sum of all responsibility shares should be equal to 100%. For example: When category "electrical PTO" is identified twice in the RFQ and "VCU" is identified twice in the RFQ and category "Battery Cooling System" once, then the responsibility share of BES-C should 75 percent and of BEB-S should be 25 percent.

                        Please summarize the following RFQ text into a SUMMARY of maximum 300 words.
                        Then identify the categories <System 1>, <System 2>, ... that are relevant in the RFQ. Do not identify categories that are not mentioned in DEPSTRUCT and list only the most important categories. Do not list more than 5 categories.
                        Then identify the work activities <work activity 1>, <work activity 2>, ... in the RFQ that belong to the identified work activities (DEVDIS). Do not identify work activities that are not mentioned in DEPSTRUCT.
                        Afterwards identify the responsible departments <department-1>, <department-2>, ... which are responsible for both the identified categories/SYSTEMS as well as work activities (DEVDIS). Do not identify departments that are not mentioned in DEPSTRUCT.
                        Estimate the share of responsibility in percent of each department <responsibility-share-department-1>, <responsibility-share-department-2>, ... in the RFQ. The responsibility should represent the relevance of the RFQ for the identified departments while the sum of all responsibility shares should be equal to 100%. For example: When category "electrical PTO" is identified twice in the RFQ and "VCU" is identified twice in the RFQ and category "Battery Cooling System" once, then the responsibility share of BES-C should 75 percent and of BEB-S should be 25 percent.
                        Identify the contact-person of each department <contact-person 1>, <contact-person-2>. For example: "Dr. Felix Richert" is contact-person for Department "BES".
                        Please use valid JSON according to the following format for your response:
